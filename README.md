## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This is just a simple admin dashboard design that was built using CSS Grid. CSS Grid was used for the majority of the layout with some small sections using Flexbox.

## Optimizations:

I would like to go back to this admin dashboard and refactor it and make it responsive and add some other pages that are in the left navigation.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a great opportunity to work with CSS Grid. I have mainly used Flexbox for my layouts so it was nice to see how powerful CSS Grid can be and how useful it is to use both these layout tools together.
